This message could be logged multiple times per frame and was not helpful.\n* Fixed Meta-specific eye-tracking manifest permissions to be added only to apps targeting Meta Quest Pro devices.\n* Fixed an issue where spacewarp may assign motion vector textures to wrong render passes when using secondary views.\n* Fixed a bug when allocating array swapchain failed, the index was incremented incorrectly. \n* Fixed an issue when OpenXR feature didn't have all the attribute entries setup."
