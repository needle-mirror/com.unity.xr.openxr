    "changelog": "### Changed\n\n* Changed wording of validation rule that checks for symmetric projection when using the Multiview Render Regions Optimizations Mode.\n* Changed OpenXR loader version to 1.1.53.\n* Changed the visibility mask to not create an occlusion mesh when using a 2022.3 editor to reduce memory footprint.\n\n### Removed\n\n* Removed an unit test `PluginVersion` which was used internally to validate package version.\n\n### Fixed\n\n * Fixed the OpenXR test \"DuplicateSettingAssetTest\" to communicate with asset database when swapping asset files.\n * Fixed an issue in OpenXR Runtime Debugger window to show correctly sized buttons. ([OXRB-682](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/folder-button-in-openxr-runtime-debugger-window-is-oversized))\n * Fixed a dependency issue by including AndroidJNI as a dependency. ([OXRB-696](https://jira.unity3d.com/browse/OXRB-696))\n * Fixed a crash when using eye tracked foveated rendering and sleeping/waking device by making sure primary swapchain reference was reset before applying foveation profile.\n * Fixed unreliable writing of `xr-meta-enabled` to boot.config by ensuring it is always set based on the actual feature state.\n * Fixed Bluetooth permissions being removed when building apps using the Meta Quest Feature. The permissions are now kept when required by Unity APIs or a plugin's manifest. For more information on Android permissions in Unity, refer to [Android App Manifest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.2/Documentation/Manual/android-manifest.html).\n * Fixed issue where project settings window would fail to render if an OpenXR Feature was removed while the editor was running. ([OXRB-715](https://jira.unity3d.com/browse/OXRB-715))\n * Fixed an error in Project Validation related to EntityId's in Unity 6000.4+."
