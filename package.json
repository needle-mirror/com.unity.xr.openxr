    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Expose `IsAdditive` and `AddAdditiveActions` APIs to allow external additive features to augment exisiting interaction profiles.\n* Added [new package sample](xref:mock-runtime-tests-sample) that demonstrates usage of the `MockOpenXREnvironment` testing APIs.\n* Added the following members to the [OpenXR native API](xref:openxr-native-api):\n  * `OpenXRNativeApi.xrCreateSpatialEntityFromIdEXT(XrSpatialContextEXT, XrSpatialEntityIdEXT, out XrSpatialEntityEXT)`\n  * `OpenXRNativeApi.xrCreateSpatialPersistenceContextAsyncEXT(XrSpatialPersistenceScopeEXT out XrFutureEXT)`\n* Added members to the `XrStructureType` enum. `XrStructureType` now contains all OpenXR values as of OpenXR version 1.1.53.\n* Added URP Compatibility to OpenXR Samples.\n* Added the `OpenXRFeatureBuildHooks.bootConfigEntryRequired` to always write a boot config entry, even when the feature is disabled.\n* Added support for the `XR_META_tile_properties_hint` extension. This extension is enabled automatically and optimizes performance for dynamic resolution and foveated rendering.\n\n### Changed\n\n* Changed the visibility mask to not create an occlusion mesh when using a 2022.3 editor to reduce memory footprint.\n* Changed wording of validation rule that checks for symmetric projection when using the Multiview Render Regions Optimizations Mode.\n* Changed OpenXR loader version to 1.1.53.\n\n### Removed\n\n* Removed OpenXR support for Universal Windows Platform on Unity 6000.4 and above.\n* Removed an unit test `PluginVersion` which was used internally to validate package version.\n* Removed verbose and redundant log message custom loader versions when browsing the OpenXR Settings view.\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fixed an issue where CI builds for samples would include code that can only run with the Unity Test Runner.\n* Fixed the OpenXR test \"DuplicateSettingAssetTest\" to communicate with asset database when swapping asset files.\n* Fixed an issue where certain composition layers would lag behind the camera's pose by a frame in instances where the composition layers are direct children of the camera's transform in the scene hierarchy.\n* Fixed a crash when using eye tracked foveated rendering and sleeping/waking device by making sure primary swapchain reference was reset before applying foveation profile.\n* Fixed an issue in OpenXR Runtime Debugger window to show correctly sized buttons. ([OXRB-682](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/folder-button-in-openxr-runtime-debugger-window-is-oversized))\n* Fixed Bluetooth permissions being removed when building apps using the Meta Quest Feature. The permissions are now kept when required by Unity APIs or a plugin's manifest. For more information on Android permissions in Unity, refer to [Android App Manifest](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.2/Documentation/Manual/android-manifest.html).\n* Fixed unreliable writing of `xr-meta-enabled` to boot.config by ensuring it is always set based on the actual feature state.\n* Fixed a dependency issue by including AndroidJNI as a dependency. ([OXRB-696](https://jira.unity3d.com/browse/OXRB-696))\n* Fixed the null exception in the Meshing and Intercept feature samples.\n* Fixed issue where project settings window would fail to render if an OpenXR Feature was removed while the editor was running. ([OXRB-715](https://jira.unity3d.com/browse/OXRB-715))\n* Fixed an error in Project Validation related to EntityId's in Unity 6000.4+.\n* Fixed the OpenXR Native API to prevent the possibility of unexpected quits when you call APIs that require a valid OpenXR session but none exists.\n* Fixed the XRInput Controller Sample to allow the right controller to display even if the left isn't connected.\n* Fixed an issue where a validation rule only meant for Android was seen on Standalone platform.\n* Fixed Android build exception when Meta Quest Pro interaction profile enabled and an OpenXR feature created without OpenXRExtensionStrings attribute.\n* Fixed an edge case where the OpenXR Plugin would throw an error when choosing a custom OpenXR loader based on its feature's OpenXR specification version.\n* Fixed Mono-API d"
