    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Added support for OpenXR features to define the OpenXR API version required to fully function.\n* Added members to the `XrStructureType` enum. `XrStructureType` now contains all OpenXR values as of OpenXR version 1.1.49.\n* Added support for multiple OpenXR features to define a custom loader and define the OpenXR API version that is supported by the feature's loader.\n* Added the [OpenXR native API](xref:openxr-native-api) with initial support for the following extensions:\n  * `XR_EXT_future`\n  * `XR_EXT_spatial_anchor`\n  * `XR_EXT_spatial_entity`\n  * `XR_EXT_spatial_marker_tracking`\n  * `XR_EXT_spatial_persistence`\n  * `XR_EXT_spatial_persistence_operations`\n  * `XR_EXT_spatial_plane_tracking`\n* Added `RenderTexture` support for Composition Layers.\n* Added class `MockOpenXREnvironment` and `MockOpenXREnvironmentSettings` for testing low-level runtime functionality using the Mock Runtime feature.\n* Added [PollEventRouter](xref:UnityEngine.XR.OpenXR.NativeTypes.PollEventRouter), a new type that allows you to subscribe to `xrPollEvent` events.\n* Added feature to enable Automatic Viewport Dynamic Resolution for compatible devices. Refer to [Automatic Viewport Dynamic Resolution](xref:openxr-automatic-dynamic-resolution) for information.\n* Added MSAA support for Windows+Vulkan builds.\n\n### Changed\n* Changed OpenXR loader version to 1.1.49.\n* Changed sample count of SwapchainCreateInfo to 1 as default instead of recommendedSwapchainSampleCount returning from the runtime.\n* Updated minimum supported version from 2021.3 to 2022.3.\n* Changed the OpenXR Validation for the minimum Android API level to only apply to Unity 6.2 and older versions.\n\n### Removed\n* Removed the validation warning to enable the OpenXR package if an OpenXR feature is enabled. Instead, OpenXR validation will only run when the OpenXR loader is selected as active loader.\n* Remove HoloLens documentation as Unity has deprecated its support. Refer to [the public announcement](https://discussions.unity.com/t/hololens-2-deprecation/1661529) for more information."
