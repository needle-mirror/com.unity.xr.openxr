# HP Reverb G2 Controller Profile

Enables the OpenXR interaction profile for the HP Reverb G2 Controller and exposes the `<ReverbG2Controller>` device layout within the [Unity Input System](xref:input-system-index).

For more information about the HP Reverb G2 interaction profile, refer to the [OpenXR Specification](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.0/html/xrspec.html#XR_EXT_hp_mixed_reality_controller).
