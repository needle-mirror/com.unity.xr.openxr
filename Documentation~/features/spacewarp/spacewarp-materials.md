# Configure Materials for SpaceWarp

You can apply Application SpaceWarp to specific objects by changing the **XR Motion Vectors Pass (Space Warp)** property of their assigned Material. You can find the **XR Motion Vectors Pass (Space Warp)** property in the **Advanced Options** section of the **Inspector** window for a Material. Objects with **XR Motion Vectors Pass (Space Warp)** disabled are not warped.

> [!TIP]
> If the **XR Motion Vectors Pass (Space Warp)** option is disabled or missing, make sure that your Unity project meets the [Prerequisites](xref:openxr-spacewarp-prerequisites) for using Application SpaceWarp.
