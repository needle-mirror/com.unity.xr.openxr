# Meta Quest Support

Understand how to configure the OpenXR plug-in for Meta Quest devices.

The Meta Quest Support feature enables Meta Quest support for the OpenXR plug-in. The **Meta Quest Support** window provides configurable settings specific for Meta Quest devices.

Refer to the following sections to understand how to [Enable Meta Quest Support](#Enable-support), and the [Settings](#settings) you can configure.

## Enable Meta Quest Support {#enable}

To deploy to Meta Quest, enable the Meta Quest Support feature on the Android build target as follows:

1. Open the Project Settings window (menu: **Edit > Project Settings**).
2. Select the **XR Plug-in Management** from the list of settings on the left.
3. If necessary, enable **OpenXR** in the list of **Plug-in Providers**. Unity installs the OpenXR plug-in, if not already installed.
4. Select the OpenXR settings page under XR Plug-in Management.
5. Add the **Oculus Touch Controller Profile** to the **Interaction Profiles** list. (You can have multiple profiles enabled in the list, the OpenXR chooses the one to use based on the current device at runtime.)
6. Enable **Meta Quest Support** under **OpenXR Feature Groups**.

When you enable Meta Quest Support, Unity produces Application Package Kit (APK) files that you can run on the Quest family of devices.

## Open the Meta Quest Support window

The **Meta Quest Support** settings window provides the settings you can configure for OpenXR support on Meta Quest devices.

To open the **Meta Quest Support** window:

1. Open the **OpenXR** section of **XR Plug-in Management** (menu: **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **XR Plug-in Management** > **OpenXR**).
2. Under **OpenXR Feature Groups**, enable **Meta Quest Support**.
3. Click the gear icon next to **Meta Quest Support** to open **Meta Quest Support** settings.

## Settings reference {#settings}

The following sections provide a reference of the settings you can configure in the **Meta Quest Support** window.

### Rendering Settings

Use the following settings to configure rendering in your project:

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| :---------- | :-------------- |
| **Symmetric Projection (Vulkan)** | If enabled, when the application begins it will create a stereo symmetric view that changes the eye buffer resolution based on the Inter-Pupillary Distance (IPD). Provides a performance benefit across all IPD values. |
| **Optimize Buffer Discards (Vulkan)** | Enable this setting to enable an optimization that allows 4x Multi Sample Anti Aliasing (MSAA) textures to be memoryless on Vulkan. |
| **Multiview Render Regions Optimizations (Vulkan)** | Choose whether you enable Multiview Render Regions optimization and the mode of Multiview Render Regions optimization.<br>In Unity 6.2 and newer, the options are: **None**, **All Passes**, **Final Pass**.<br>To learn more about this feature, refer to [Multiview Render Regions](xref:openxr-multiview-render-regions). |
| **Space Warp motion vector texture format** | Choose the format used by the motion vector texture to store its values. The option you choose depends on whether you want to prioritize visual quality and performance. <br>The options you can use are:<ul><li><strong> RGBA16f: </strong> Use this for more precise values. This can improve the visual quality of Space Warp.</li><li><strong>RG16f: </strong>Use this option for reduced memory usage, but slightly less precision.</li></ul>To learn more about Space Warp, refer to [URP Application Spacewarp](xref:um-xr-application-spacewarp). |

### Manifest Settings

Use the following settings to configure your project manifest:

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| :---------- | :-------------- |
| **Force Remove Internet Permission** | Enable to force the removal of internet permissions added to the [Android App Manifest](xref:um-android-manifest). |
| **System Splash Screen** | Uses a `PNG` in the `Assets` folder as the system splash screen image. If set, the OS will display the system splash screen as a high quality compositor layer as soon as the app is starting to launch, until the app submits the first frame.<br>Use the picker (&#8857;) to select an image from the `Assets` folder you want to use as the system splash screen image. |

### Target Devices

Select the Quest devices your project targets.

### Experimental

The **Experimental** section contains experimental settings that are under active development.

> [!NOTE]
> Experimental settings might change before they’re verified.
