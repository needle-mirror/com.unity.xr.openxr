# Hand Interaction Profile

The hand interaction profile is designed for runtimes which provide hand inputs using hand tracking devices instead of controllers with triggers or buttons.
The hand interaction profile allows hand tracking devices to provide commonly used gestures and action poses. Enable this OpenXR interaction profile to expose the `<HandInteraction>` device layout within the [Unity Input System](xref:input-system-index).

OpenXR Specification about Hand Interaction Profile will be updated here when it is available.

## Available controls

The following table outlines the mapping between the OpenXR paths and Unity's implementation:

| OpenXR Path | Unity Control Name | Type |
|----|----|----|
|`/input/grip/pose` | devicePose | Pose |
|`/input/aim/pose` | pointer | Pose |
|`/input/pinch_ext/pose` | pinchPose | Pose |
|`/input/poke_ext/pose` | pokePose | Pose |
|`/input/pinch_ext/value`| pinchValue | Float |
|`/input/pinch_ext/ready_ext` | pinchReady | Boolean|
|`/input/aim_activate_ext/value`| pointerActivateValue | Float |
|`/input/aim_activate_ext/ready_ext` | pointerActivateReady | Boolean|
|`/input/grasp_ext/value`| graspValue | Float |
|`/input/grasp_ext/ready_ext` | graspReady | Boolean|
| Unity Layout Only  | isTracked | Flag Data |
| Unity Layout Only  | trackingState | Flag Data |
| Unity Layout Only  | devicePosition | Vector3 |
